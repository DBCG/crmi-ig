This example demonstrates how licensing information can be attached to FHIR knowledge artifacts using CRMI extensions. 

The library shows two properties to artifact licensing:
1. **License Code**: A standardized code (like 'not-open-source') that provides machine-readable license classification
2. **License Detail**: Human-readable markdown text that contains the full license terms, contact information, and usage restrictions

This approach enables both automated license compliance checking through standardized codes and detailed legal clarity through comprehensive license text.
