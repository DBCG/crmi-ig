* description = """
The CRMI publish operation processes a publishable bundle containing knowledge
artifacts and their metadata.

This operation is based on the core FHIR Bundle operation but requires that the
input Bundle conforms to the CRMIPublishableBundle profile. The bundle must be
of type 'transaction' and must contain an ImplementationGuide resource as the
first entry.

The operation enables atomic publication of related knowledge artifacts (such as
Libraries, ActivityDefinitions, PlanDefinitions, Measures, etc.) along with
their governing ImplementationGuide, ensuring consistent deployment and proper
metadata management.

* comment = """
The CRMI publish operation processes knowledge artifact bundles atomically,
ensuring that all resources in the bundle are published together or the entire
operation fails. This maintains the integrity of knowledge artifact packages and
their dependencies.

The operation validates that:
1. The bundle conforms to CRMIPublishableBundle profile
2. The first entry contains an ImplementationGuide
3. All bundle entries have proper transaction requests
4. Referenced resources within the bundle are consistent
